This project leverages NumPy, pandas, and SciPy to optimize item packaging within a given weight capacity while minimizing total weight and cost per unit weight. By applying calculus and Python programming principles, it ensures that weight constraints are met efficiently. The optimization process is structured with step-by-step tracking, including input collection, variable declaration, objective function definition, and result interpretation. Additionally, the project emphasizes space utilization, cost reduction, scalability, and user-friendly interaction. The results are visualized using Matplotlib, providing clear insights into the optimization process. A comparative analysis highlights similarities in objective functions and constraints while noting differences in computational efficiency, flexibility, and accuracy. This approach enhances decision-making in weight-based optimizations, making it a valuable tool for logistics and resource management.
