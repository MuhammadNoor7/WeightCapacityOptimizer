# Introduction
This project focuses on weight-based optimization using Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and SciPy. It aims to efficiently manage item packaging by minimizing total weight and cost per unit weight while adhering to given constraints.

#Explanation
The process involves structured steps including input handling, variable declaration, defining the objective function, and interpreting results. By integrating calculus principles with Python programming, the solution ensures optimal space utilization and cost efficiency. Visualizations created using Matplotlib offer intuitive insights into the optimization flow. The project also includes a comparative analysis of different approaches, examining similarities in constraints and variations in performance metrics. Emphasis is placed on flexibility, accuracy, and user-friendly design, making it suitable for real-world applications in logistics and resource management.
